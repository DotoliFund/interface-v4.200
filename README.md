# Dotoli Interface

This repository contains the interface for the Dotoli Protocol.

Introducing Dotoli, based on ERC-20, a decentralized fund management
protocol for managing and investing in cryptocurrency assets. You can manage
token assets while swapping Ethereum-based ERC-20 token assets using the
Uniswap V3 contract.

## Fund
 All deposits, withdrawals and swap information of both fund managers and investors
are stored transparently in the Ethereum blockchain, which is advantageous to both fund
managers and investors.

## Manager
 If all fund operations are transparently and completely recorded on the blockchain, the
fund manager's asset management portfolio cannot be forged or modified. The
advantage of this is that if the fund manager himself has a high investment return rate,
his investment activities so far become his portfolio, and a portfolio with good
performance is good information for investors who need a competent fund manager. In
addition, since fund managers do not work as employees of existing financial
companies, they can independently grow and manage their assets without restrictions.


## Investor
 Since the fund is operated only according to the rules of the Dotoli contract of the
Ethereum blockchain, which is close to decentralization, it is safe from malicious
actions by third parties. For example, if investor B deposits cryptocurrency into a fund
created by fund manager A, only the investor can withdraw. Fund managers can only
swap deposited assets or add/remove them to the Uniswap pool.
